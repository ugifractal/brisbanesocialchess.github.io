statutory requirement.</li><li>Rob noted that for non-profit organisations the return is fairly easy, an office bearer must lodge and can do so on-line, via mail or by phone. There are a few quirks to the "how to lodge" process.</li><li>The alternative is to cancel our ABN which could be appropriate as BSC has effectively not engaged in profit making business over the last 12 months.</li><li>Matt noted that an ABN is required to apply for grants.</li><li>Matt advised his tax agent is progressing an NFP on behalf of BSC.</li><li>The committee discussed the pros and cons of continuing the ABN.</li><li>A vote of the committee unanimously agreed to continue the ABN.</li></ul></li><li class="space-y-2">Preparation for the Annual General Meeting.<ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6 space-y-1"><li>Steve suggested that some early preparation for our next AGM would make the process easier.</li><li>Steve suggested that a list of tasks with identified responsibilities would be useful as would an early forecast of a date.</li><li>Rob stated that he would prepare accounts again after the end of the financial year.</li><li>Rob noted that there would need to be a call for nominations to office bearers and suggested that it would be ideal to prepare for actual elections should more than one candidate nominate.</li></ul></li><li class="space-y-2">Business cards.<ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6 space-y-1"><li>Matt noted that it is possible to get 250 business cards for about $100.</li><li>Rob noted the need to decide what goes on the card and that there is no BSC logo or phone number.</li><li>Matt suggested that contact could be via MeetUp as there are 14 people who can respond.</li><li>Steve asked if it was appropriate that any of the MeetUp contacts could respond to business enquiries without necessarily knowing the BSC committee view.</li><li>Matt wondered if we could use email however noted that this then required monitoring of the email account.</li><li>General discussion considered that business cards were a good idea however some details need to be worked out.</li></ul></li><li class="space-y-2">General Business.<ul class="list-disc list-inside pl-6 space-y-1"><li>After some issues with payment of membership the status of Ben as a committee member in terms of the BSC constitution was discussed.</li><li>Matt moved that Ben be re-appointed to the committee, seconded by Steve and unanimously agreed.</li></ul></li></ol><p class="leading-relaxed font-semibold mt-2"><strong>Next meeting:</strong> in 2 months, Jimmy to advise of a suitable date.</p></article><div class="my-6"><hr class="border-gray-500"></div><article class="mb-6"><h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-2 text-center">June 2024 – Committee Meeting (24/06/2025)</h3><p class="mb-3"><strong>Attendees: </strong>Jimmy, John, Matt, Rob, Steve<br><strong>Apologies: </strong>Ben</p><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-2 mb-3"><li>Business from last meeting:<ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-1"><li>Business cards - Matt advised that he has had 100 business cards created. They are available to members on a needs basis. The cost of this was approximately $50. Motion: moved Steve, second Rob: That Matt should be reimbursed for the cost of producing the cards.

Matt advised that he had submitted this and the matter is now complete for this year.</li></ul></li><li>Agenda items:<ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 space-y-1"><li>Rob: The need for a review of our subscription with <a href="https://meetup.com/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500">meetup.com</a> and consideration of possible lower cost alternatives. Rob submitted a separate email detailing pros and cons; and possible ways forward.<br>Initial discussion noted the visibility <a href="https://meetup.com/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500">meetup.com</a> provides to BSC especially for people searching for chess opportunities via the internet. Matt advised that <a href="https://meetup.com/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500">meetup.com</a> has recently significantly increased the cost of subscriptions to $200 US per six months. Until recently <a href="https://meetup.com/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500">meetup.com</a> were going to pay for our subscription in return for affiliation however this arrangement has ceased and <a href="https://meetup.com/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500">meetup.com</a> are now not retaining any websites. In view of the changed situation the following motion was voted on:<br>Motion: That the BSC <a href="https://meetup.com/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500">meetup.com</a> subscription is allowed to expire at the end of the current subscription period on 09/08/2025 and members are contacted in advance of this date to advise of this exit. Moved Rob, seconded Matt. Unanimously passed.<br>Matt & John will work on improving our website & exporting member data from <a href="https://meetup.com/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500">meetup.com</a> to provide continued member contact and to manage our on line visibility.<br>Steve will contact members via meetup to inform them of the impending change & the reason for this.</li><li>Matt: Discussions with <a href="https://meetup.com/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500">meetup.com</a><br>Matt has been in contact with Judit Sztaray, director of chess club relations with <a href="https://meetup.com/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500">meetup.com</a>. While chess.com have ceased support for external websites they have offered BSC a free account on <a href="https://meetup.com/" class="text-blue-400 hover:text-blue-500">meetup.com</a> called "Brisbane Social Chess".<br><b>Motion:</b> That BSC accept and use a chess.com account called Brisbane Social Chess.

First steps could be to choose a date and prepare a Notice of Meeting. Rob noted the need to include a financial report in the Notice so that this can be approved at the AGM. This then requires that annual accounts are completed before the Notice can be submitted. Rob also noted that the Notice must include any resolutions to be considered and could include, for example, committee size. General discussion noted the desirability of including some reporting of BSC committee activity over the last year in the Notice such as some commentary from the President or an indication of how many committee meetings and resolutions were had during the year.<br>A tentative date for the AGM of Sunday the 31st August 2025 was agreed. Matt will collect the necessary documentation and Rob will prepare the annual financial report when this is done. Steve will draft a Notice of Meeting for committee consideration.</li></ol><p class="leading-relaxed font-semibold mt-2"><strong>Next meeting:</strong> in 1 month.</p></article><div class="my-6"><hr class="border-gray-500"></div><article class="mb-6"><h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">Dec 2024 – Committee Meeting (03/12/2024)</h3><p class="mb-4"><strong>Present:</strong> Jimmy, Matt, Rob, Steve<br><strong>Apologies:</strong> Ben, John</p><ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-3 mb-4"><li>Applications for grants:<ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-1 space-y-1"><li>Matt advises that he has submitted an application for a $35,000 grant to the Gambling Community Benefit Fund. He is optimistic about the prospects of the application. Applications generally take 2-3 months to be assessed.</li></ul></li><li>Sponsorships:<ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-1 space-y-1"><li>Matt has pursued contact with Chess.com via meetings with Judith from that organisation, seeking to negotiate an arrangement more suited to BSC needs. Matt has proposed that BSC should be affiliated to Chess.com with Chess.com paying <a href="https://meetup.com/" class="text-blue-400 underline">meetup.com</a> fees. Matt sought committee confirmation of this position.</li><li>Motion: Steve moved that: BSC should agree to affiliation with Chess.com, with Chess.com to pay BSC <a href="https://meetup.com/" class="text-blue-400 underline">meetup.com</a> fees. This was seconded by Matt and unanimously agreed to.</li><li>Matt noted that Chess.com would also provide a subscription to Chess.com.

He noted the potential impact on BSC reputation should this not be done. It was agreed that this is best practice.</li><li>Rob queried whether events should go ahead if the nominated host can't attend the event. His concerns are linked to legal liability and BSC reputation. He noted the potential to impact new members. There was some discussion around the appointment of proxy hosts and the slightly unusual arrangements at Chocolate Moments where there is a nominal host and an actual host. No definitive rules were established however all agreed that the committee needs to continue monitoring venues.</li></ul></li><li>Stripe payment system:<ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-1 space-y-1"><li>Rob noted that receipts issued via Stripe for BSC membership and sponsorship still show Rob's name on the receipt rather than BSC. He has made some efforts to change this however this has not worked as yet. Rob has passed on email contact details for Steve, Jimmy and Matt to Stripe with the intention of allowing others to operate Stripe as required. He will pursue changing receipts to show BSC and the club ABN.</li></ul></li><li>Status of current meetups:<ul class="list-disc list-inside ml-5 mt-1 space-y-1"><li>Jimmy advised that Thursday nights are going well, with 8-12 attendees, that the venue is supportive and that John manages players well through shuffling match ups.

Matt advised he had declined this offer as it cedes control of the meetup account to chess.com and is contrary to the aim of playing live games of chess.
