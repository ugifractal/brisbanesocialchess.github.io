We are registered in Queensland and have a dedicated team of organizers.

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

For detailed development setup instructions, see [DEVELOPER_HELP.md](DEVELOPER_HELP.md).

Experiment with Lerna and bootup a local developer playground from the repository root with: `npx lerna run dev`.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) is a static site hosting service offered by GitHub, enabling users to host sites directly from their GitHub repositories. It is designed for publishing static content, meaning it primarily handles HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, and does not support server-side languages like PHP or Python for dynamic content generation.
- [Read the Docs](https://about.readthedocs.com/) is a Continuous Documentation Deployment platform designed to simplify the process of building, versioning, and hosting technical documentation, particularly for software projects. It operates on the principle of "docs as code," integrating with version control systems like Git (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to automatically build and update documentation whenever changes are committed to the repository.
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/) is a connectivity cloud that provides a range of services to improve the security, performance, and reliability of sites and applications. It acts as a Content Delivery Network (CDN), reverse proxy, and provides cybersecurity solutions. In essence, Cloudflare helps businesses connect, protect, and build their online presence.
- [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/) is a serverless platform for building, deploying, and scaling apps across Cloudflare's global network `↗` with a single command - no infrastructure to manage, no complex configuration.
- [Cloudflare Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) is a command-line tool designed to help developers build and manage applications on the Cloudflare developer platform, particularly for Cloudflare Workers. It streamlines the process of deploying, testing, and configuring Workers, as well as interacting with other Cloudflare developer products.
- [Cloudflare D1](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-au/developer-platform/products/d1/) is a serverless relational database in seconds with D1. With a familiar SQL query language, point-in-time recovery, and cost-effective pricing, you are empowered to build the next big thing.
- [Lerna](https://lerna.js.org/) is a tool for optimizing the workflow around managing multi-package repositories (monorepos).
- [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) is a blazing-fast, next-generation testing framework designed for modern JavaScript and TypeScript projects, built on top of Vite. It's known for its speed and developer experience, offering instant feedback and seamless integration with Vite's features like hot module replacement (HMR). Vitest is inspired by Jest and aims to provide a familiar yet enhanced testing experience.
- [Eleventy (also known as 11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/) is a static site generator. It's a tool that transforms content (like Markdown, HTML, or JavaScript) and templates into static HTML files, making it faster and easier to build sites. Unlike dynamic site builders, 11ty generates all the site's content upfront, which leads to better performance and simpler deployments.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) is a utility-first CSS framework designed for rapidly building custom user interfaces directly within HTML. Unlike traditional CSS frameworks that provide pre-built components (like buttons or navigation bars), Tailwind offers a comprehensive set of low-level utility classes.
- [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) is a powerful and flexible templating engine for JavaScript, heavily inspired by Jinja2 (a popular templating engine for Python). It allows developers to create dynamic HTML, XML, or other text-based content by embedding logic, variables, and control structures directly within templates.
- [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) is a powerful and widely-used documentation generator written in Python. It is particularly popular within the Python community and is considered the de facto standard for documenting Python projects.
- [reStructuredText (RST)](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) is a lightweight markup language designed for creating easy-to-read and easy-to-write plaintext documents that can be automatically converted to various output formats, such as HTML, LaTeX (and thus PDF), and more. It is a key component of the Docutils project and is widely used in the Python community for writing technical documentation, including Python's official documentation and documentation for many Python libraries.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is an open-source platform designed to simplify the process of building, deploying, and running applications using containerization. It packages an application and all its dependencies (libraries, system tools, code, runtime) into a standardized unit called a "container."

<!-- dprint-ignore-start -->

- [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile) is a text file that contains a set of instructions used by the [make](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)>) utility to automate the process of building and managing software projects. It defines dependencies between files and specifies the commands required to update outdated files or generate new ones.

### ⚡ Cloudflare Workers Development

To work with the Cloudflare Workers site in the `packages/cfsite` directory:

#### ▶️ Start Development Server

```bash
cd packages/cfsite
npx wrangler dev
```

#### 🏃 Run Tests

```bash
cd packages/cfsite
npm run test
```

Read below for instructions about the current static development site hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

---

### 🏗️ Getting Started / Building the Site

To start a local development server with live reload, run:

```bash
npm run start
```

---

### 🐳 Build the Docker image for running `pre-commit` easily

- Arm 64:

```bash
mkdir docker_data
docker buildx build --platform=linux/arm64 -t ubuntu-pre-commit .
docker run --platform=linux/arm64 -it -v "$PWD":/app -v "$PWD/docker_data/.cache/pre-commit":/root/.cache/pre-commit -v "$PWD/docker_data/.npm":/root/.npm -w /app ubuntu-pre-commit:latest bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

- Amd 64:

```bash
mkdir docker_data
docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64 -t ubuntu-pre-commit .
docker run --platform=linux/amd64 -it -v "$PWD":/app -v "$PWD/docker_data/.cache/pre-commit":/root/.cache/pre-commit -v "$PWD/docker_data/.npm":/root/.npm -w /app ubuntu-pre-commit:latest bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

---

### 📚 Build the Documentation

Run the following commands from the repo root to create the Sphinx documentation with Make:

```shell
cd doc
make html
```

The generated HTML site will be in the `doc/build/html` folder.
You can open the HTML files with your web browser.
