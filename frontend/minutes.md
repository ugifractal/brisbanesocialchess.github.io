        <h3>May 2025 – Committee Meeting (25/03/2025)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Present:</strong> Jimmy, Steve, Rob, Matt <br />
            <strong>Apologies:</strong> Ben
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Need to either lodge an annual Not For Profit (NFP) self-review return to confirm eligibility for income tax exemption or
                cancel ABN.
                <ul>
                    <li>Rob advised that this is a statutory requirement.</li>
                    <li>
                        Rob noted that for non-profit organisations the return is fairly easy, an office bearer must lodge and can do so
                        on-line, via mail or by phone. There are a few quirks to the "how to lodge" process.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The alternative is to cancel our ABN which could be appropriate as BSC has effectively not engaged in profit making
                        business over the last 12 months.
                    </li>
                    <li>Matt noted that an ABN is required to apply for grants.</li>
                    <li>Matt advised his tax agent is progressing an NFP on behalf of BSC.</li>
                    <li>The committee discussed the pros and cons of continuing the ABN.</li>
                    <li>A vote of the committee unanimously agreed to continue the ABN.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Preparation for the Annual General Meeting.
                <ul>
                    <li>Steve suggested that some early preparation for our next AGM would make the process easier.</li>
                    <li>
                        Steve suggested that a list of tasks with identified responsibilities would be useful as would an early forecast of a
                        date.
                    </li>
                    <li>Rob stated that he would prepare accounts again after the end of the financial year.</li>
                    <li>
                        Rob noted that there would need to be a call for nominations to office bearers and suggested that it would be ideal to
                        prepare for actual elections should more than one candidate nominate.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Business cards.
                <ul>
                    <li>Matt noted that it is possible to get 250 business cards for about $100.</li>
                    <li>Rob noted the need to decide what goes on the card and that there is no BSC logo or phone number.</li>
                    <li>Matt suggested that contact could be via MeetUp as there are 14 people who can respond.</li>
                    <li>
                        Steve asked if it was appropriate that any of the MeetUp contacts could respond to business enquiries without
                        necessarily knowing the BSC committee view.
                    </li>
                    <li>Matt wondered if we could use email however noted that this then required monitoring of the email account.</li>
                    <li>General discussion considered that business cards were a good idea however some details need to be worked out.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                General Business.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        After some issues with payment of membership the status of Ben as a committee member in terms of the BSC constitution
                        was discussed.
                    </li>
                    <li>Matt moved that Ben be re-appointed to the committee, seconded by Steve and unanimously agreed.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p><strong>Next meeting:</strong> in 2 months, Jimmy to advise of a suitable date.</p>

                Business from last meeting:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Business cards - Matt advised that he has had 100 business cards created. They are available to members on a needs
                        basis. The cost of this was approximately $50. Motion: moved Steve, second Rob: That Matt should be reimbursed for the
                        cost of producing the cards. Unanimously passed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Status of the submission of the Not For Profit report. Matt advised that he had submitted this and the matter is now
                        complete for this year.
                    </li>

                Agenda items:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rob: The need for a review of our subscription with <a href="https://meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> and consideration of
                        possible lower cost alternatives. Rob submitted a separate email detailing pros and cons; and possible ways forward.
                        <br />
                        Initial discussion noted the visibility <a href="https://meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> provides to BSC especially for
                        people searching for chess opportunities via the internet. Matt advised that
                        <a href="https://meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> has recently significantly increased the cost of subscriptions to $200 US
                        per six months. Until recently <a href="https://meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> were going to pay for our subscription in
                        return for affiliation however this arrangement has ceased and <a href="https://meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> are now not
                        retaining any websites. In view of the changed situation the following motion was voted on: <br />
                        Motion: That the BSC <a href="https://meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> subscription is allowed to expire at the end of the
                        current subscription period on 09/08/2025 and members are contacted in advance of this date to advise of this exit.
                        Moved Rob, seconded Matt. Unanimously passed. <br />
                        Matt & John will work on improving our website & exporting member data from
                        <a href="https://meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> to provide continued member contact and to manage our on line visibility.
                        <br />
                        Steve will contact members via meetup to inform them of the impending change & the reason for this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Matt: Discussions with <a href="https://meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> <br />
                        Matt has been in contact with Judit Sztaray, director of chess club relations with
                        <a href="https://meetup.com/">meetup.com</a>. While chess.com have ceased support for external websites they have
                        offered BSC a free account on <a href="https://meetup.com/">meetup.com</a> called "Brisbane Social Chess". <br />
                        <b>Motion:</b> That BSC accept and use a chess.com account called Brisbane Social Chess. Moved by Matt, seconded by Rob.
                        Unanimously passed. <br />
                        This account will be administered by John.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Applications for grants <br />
                        Matt advised that he has prepared documentation for grant submissions to:
                        <ul>
                            <li>The Queensland Country Bank;</li>
                            <li>The Brisbane City Council Lord Mayor's Grants;</li>
                            <li>The Queensland Gambling Community Benefit Fund.</li>
                        </ul>
                        It was agreed that all should proceed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Steve: AGM first steps <br />
                Steve suggested that we should start preparation for this year's AGM. First steps could be to choose a date and prepare a
                Notice of Meeting. Rob noted the need to include a financial report in the Notice so that this can be approved at the AGM.
                This then requires that annual accounts are completed before the Notice can be submitted. Rob also noted that the Notice
                must include any resolutions to be considered and could include, for example, committee size. General discussion noted the
                desirability of including some reporting of BSC committee activity over the last year in the Notice such as some commentary
                from the President or an indication of how many committee meetings and resolutions were had during the year. <br />
                A tentative date for the AGM of Sunday the 31st August 2025 was agreed. Matt will collect the necessary documentation and
                Rob will prepare the annual financial report when this is done. Steve will draft a Notice of Meeting for committee
                consideration.
            </li>
        </ol>
        Next meeting: in 1 month.

        <h3>Dec 2024 – Committee Meeting (03/12/2024)</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Present:</strong> Jimmy, Matt, Steve, Rob <br />
            <strong>Apologies:</strong> John, Ben
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Applications for grants:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Matt advises that he has submitted an application for a $35,000 grant to the Gambling Community Benefit Fund. He is
                        optimistic about the prospects of the application. Applications generally take 2-3 months to be assessed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Sponsorships:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Matt has pursued contact with Chess.com via meetings with Judith from that organisation, seeking to negotiate an
                        arrangement more suited to BSC needs. Matt has proposed that BSC should be affiliated to Chess.com with Chess.com paying
                        BSC [meetup.com](https://meetup.com/) fees. Matt sought committee confirmation of this position.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Motion: Steve moved that: BSC should agree to affiliation with Chess.com, with Chess.com to pay BSC
                        [meetup.com](https://meetup.com/) fees. This was seconded by Matt and unanimously agreed to.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Matt noted that Chess.com would also provide a subscription to Chess.com. There was some discussion about what should be
                        done with this subscription.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Motion: Rob moved that the sponsorship should be treated as a donation. Seconded by Matt and unanimously agreed to.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Event management and host responsibilities:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rob noted the need to ensure that when venues are closed, for example over Christmas, that meetup events should also be
                        cancelled to reflect this. He noted the potential impact on BSC reputation should this not be done. It was agreed that
                        this is best practice.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rob queried whether events should go ahead if the nominated host can't attend the event. His concerns are linked to
                        legal liability and BSC reputation. He noted the potential to impact new members. There was some discussion around the
                        appointment of proxy hosts and the slightly unusual arrangements at Chocolate Moments where there is a nominal host and
                        an actual host. No definitive rules were established however all agreed that the committee needs to continue monitoring
                        venues.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Stripe payment system:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rob noted that receipts issued via Stripe for BSC membership and sponsorship still show Rob's name on the receipt rather
                        than BSC. He has made some efforts to change this however this has not worked as yet. Rob has passed on email contact
                        details for Steve, Jimmy and Matt to Stripe with the intention of allowing others to operate Stripe as required. He will
                        pursue changing receipts to show BSC and the club ABN.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Status of current meetups:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Jimmy advised that Thursday nights are going well, with 8-12 attendees, that the venue is supportive and that John
                        manages players well through shuffling match ups. Also noted that John is providing small 'prizes' for players.
                    </li>
                    <li>Matt advised that Sundays are continuing to be well attended with 14-20 players.</li>
                    <li>
                        Jimmy advised that Saturdays are also well attended with usually 12-18 players. Sunny is also a very supportive host.
                    </li>
                    <li>Steve advised that 6-8 are playing on Wednesdays.</li>
                    <li>Steve advised that 10 played on the initial meetup at Chocolate Moments.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

                        As the administrator of our meetup group Matt McLean advised he has been approached by chess.com who have offered to pay
                        our meetup cost in exchange for running the meetup account for chess.com. Matt advised he had declined this offer as it
                        cedes control of the meetup account to chess.com and is contrary to the aim of playing live games of chess. He has
                        contacted chess.com with a different offer however has not had further response at this time.

                Annual report to be lodged
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rob noted that he had sent out an email on the 15th seeking committee members' personal details as these are required to
                        complete the annual report as required by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). Rob offered to prepare the annual report if
                        committee members returned the necessary information. Matt agreed to allow his home address to be used as the official
                        BSCI address per OFT requirements. Rob said that there had been an email via the BSCI gmail account regarding this.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rob also noted that another form needs to be submitted detailing the 2 special resolutions passed at the recent AGM for
                        changes to the BSCI constitution. This needs to be signed by the Secretary (Steve).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rob noted that there is an annual fee of $62 (and some cents) to lodge the annual report and $20 to lodge the change of
                        constitution. It was agreed that Matt would lodge the annual report, pay the fee, and be reimbursed from the BSCI
                        account. It was agreed that Steve would lodge the change of constitution form, pay the fee and advise Matt of details of
                        his bank account for re-imbursement.

                        Steve noted that BSCI members had expressed concerns last year about the heat at Roma St Parklands Cafe and that wet
                        weather could be problematic at this venue. He suggested a change of venue by the start of November. Matt suggested
                        returning to Albert St or possibly 124 Creek St, both of which venues have been used previously. Committee members to
                        check venues & make a decision.

                        Matt advised that he is keen to move forward and apply for grants. It was agreed that this could go ahead, and that Matt
                        would contact committee members when assistance was required. Rob noted that if controversial matters arose in this
                        process that it would be necessary to seek the approval of the committee.

                    <li>
                        Rob Garvey addressed this motion, noting that BSCI finances precluded appointing a paid auditor. Rob offered to prepare
                        accounts on behalf of BSCI on a pro bono basis while noting that he is not an auditor or accountant. Maria Conomos
                        offered to assist.

                        Matt McLean advised that he had now created an official website (www.brisbanesocialchess.org.au). This had been created
                        to link our MeetUp and FACEBOOK accounts, to make us easier to locate via the internet and as a requirement for applying
                        for grants. Possible granting organisations include the Queensland Government, Queensland Country Banks, the gambling
                        fund and the Commonwealth Bank. Matt noted that the potential purposes of seeking grants were to run tournaments,
                        purchase chess sets for our venues and, longer term, to initiate a building fund.

                        Maria Conomos asked if BSCI have Director and Organisation insurance should there be an issue while playing. There was
                        brief general discussion concerning the cost of such insurance and the potential risks. Maria said she would be happy to
                        look into the cost and availability of such insurance.

                    <li>
                        Steve Anderson moved that this offer be accepted, Matt McLean seconded this motion. There were 11 votes in favour and
                        nil against.

                    <li>
                        Steve Anderson raised the matter of a requirement in the Constitution for the Secretary to be domiciled in Brisbane City
                        and suggested that this might not suit all financial members. Ben Martin advised that Queensland articles of association
                        require an office bearer to have a Queensland address.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Matt McLean moved that the constitution be amended to allow financial members domiciled in Queensland be eligible to be
                        elected to the Secretary of BSCI. Maria Conomos seconded this motion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Rob Garvey raised a point of order, noting that the constitution can't be changed without notice to financial members.
                        As this had not been given, it was agreed that there would be no further action in respect of this matter for the
                        present.
                    </li>
                    <li>Maria Conomos offered to run a social marketing campaign with a marketing brand. This could help with grants.</li>
                    <li>
                        Andrew Jones asked if the BSCI web site was in place. Matt McLean confirmed that it was and it can be found at
                        <a href="https://brisbanesocialchess.org.au">www.brisbanesocialchess.org.au</a>
